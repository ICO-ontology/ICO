The Informed Consent Ontology (ICO) is an ontology for the informed consent and informed consent process in the medical field. ICO is developed by following OBO Foundry principles. ICO is aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO).

As part of the consenting process in human subjects research, potential participants receive information about the purpose of the study, potential risks and benefits of participation, their rights, and the procedures to be undergone as part of the study. If the individual decides to participate, an informed consent document is signed and preserved as a record of voluntary participation in the research study. Following the OBO Foundry principles, the Informed Consent Ontology (ICO) logically represents the terms and their relations related to the informed consent process and content.
