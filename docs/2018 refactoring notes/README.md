# 2018 Refactoring Project
The changes made in 2018 reflect a move toward a reference ontology of informed consent. Goals of this effort include generalizing the representation to allow for meaningful use across multiple regulatory environments and increased alignment with ontologies in the informed consent ecosystem (d-acts, DUO, OBIB, ect.).


Below are bullet points summarizing major changes.

### Summary of Changes
- Collaborated to strengthen representations across multiple ontologies.
    - Simplify existing representations to asserted classes to support greater interoperability and multiple contexts of use at the application level.
    - Aligned ICO's representation of 'permissions' with d-acts 'document act'. This enables ICO to represent finely grained 'consent' and 'assent' processes.
    - Import and support DUO 'consent codes'.
    - Improve natural language definitions for many ICO classes.

- Expanded representation of the regulatory background.
    - Refactored the Common Rule Ontology utilizing the same design philosophy as ICO. In early 2019 these classes were merged into ICO and adopted new ICO purls.
    - Added new representation for when (ICO:stasis of regulation) and where (ICO:jurisdiction) regulation holds in order to represent complex regulations at multiple levels of granularity.

- Expanded representation of informed consent forms and their constituent parts.
    - Added new information content entities to represent informed consent forms and other regulatory documents related to informed consent.
